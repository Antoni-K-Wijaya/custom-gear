# custom-gear
Custom-gear is a repository made for the purpose of coding anything that interests the author (me). It does not have a specific technical purpose in mind. Therefore it can contain codes from any tech topics such as Security, AI, simple CRUD and such.

It is made in Golang, but it is not restricted to.
